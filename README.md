## Mandlebrot Set

This is a javascript implementation visualising the Mandlebrot Set.

Initially I just wanted to see the Mandlebrot Set itself, and then I created the sliders to explore it. The sliders are rather hacky ðŸ˜„.

Might be fun to try and implement the heavy calculations using web workers. That might free up the sliders from the blocking operations.
